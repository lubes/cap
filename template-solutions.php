                        <p>High net worth families typically have members with knowledge and input regarding financial matters. What they don’t have is a point person who’s accountable for executing the overall strategic direction. Crafting a properly diversified portfolio requires a partner with the time, skills, and resources to ensure the entire family is aligned, as well as bring order and structure to family financial affairs.</p>
                        <p>And no matter how well your portfolio performs, if the tax and estate issues are not addressed, the net result can be disappointing, and sometimes, disastrous. By focusing on all aspects of your balance sheet, Caprock is uniquely positioned to protect and manage your wealth.</p>

                        <h5>LOWERING RISK BY RAISING AWARENESS</h5>
                        <span class="break red-break"></span>
                        <p>Nobody can control the markets, but there are three things we can control: risk, fees and taxes. Risk means many things to many people. Whether it’s producing enough income, the loss of/or outliving capital, or not passing on wealth to future generations. It is our job to properly define risk for each family and mitigate it.</p>
                        <p>Believe it or not, managing fees and taxes are the key to growing wealth. Most investors have no idea what they’re paying for investment advice or options, nor do they understand the impact of taxes on total return. Fortunately, we do. We work diligently to negotiate fees on behalf of our clients and model the after-tax return profile for any investment under consideration.</p>

                        <span class="break red-break"></span>
                        <p>One of the biggest differences between us and the financial services industry is we have a framework to monitor, measure, and evaluate progress towards key family goals. This is critical to success. Comparing portfolio performance to stated objectives is important because without a clearly articulated plan, a family has no relative, personal way to evaluate performance.</p>
                        <p>We believe in creating a family’s own personal benchmark and we establish relativity using specific, detailed family objectives. For example, if a family knows that their portfolio needs to generate 5.3% in after-tax income, they can easily evaluate performance. Central to this framework is the ability to report on all assets, regardless of their location or complexity.  </p>

                        <p>At Caprock, we build portfolios with intent and design. We develop a comprehensive understanding of both a family’s assets and their mission, and from this, we construct a framework with which to evaluate every decision. Against this backdrop, we continually monitor progress towards stated goals. The result of this approach is a portfolio by design rather than by default.</p>

                        <p>These days, you can’t ignore the social and environmental consequences associated with investing. And as investors continue to see the potential, they will want their portfolios to align with their values. As a founding B Corp, our commitment to impact investing runs deep. We’ve deployed $1b+ in capital and put it across every asset class, with considerable expertise in illiquid investments. To help identify and manage risk, we analyze ESG factors associated with every investment and we report impact across the entire portfolio. Our success so far proves you don’t need to sacrifice financial returns to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

                        <p>At Caprock, impact investing is not just a specialty, it’s a passion. Years ago, when we began constructing impact portfolios, investment opportunities were woefully inadequate so we committed resources to field building. We seeded and anchored first time funds. We helped asset managers structure aligned strategies. Today, as the impact investment marketplace nears maturity, we’ve shown you can generate market-rate returns with a thematic or geographic focus. This is a key advantage for both our firm and our clients.</p>

                        <p>Caprock was founded as a family office, but a funny thing happened on the way to the marketplace. As more clients grew tired of conventional portfolios (with their commoditized management approach), a demand for something new began to take shape. The answer was impact investing, and with it, came a range of commitment levels. Some of our families wanted to go all in, while other foundations just wanted to dip their toes. Fine by us. We welcome any level of participation and would be proud to serve you on this new, exciting impact journey.</p>
